# Autum-Leaf-Assesment

Hello viewer :)

I hope you are having a great day.

Thank you for allowing me to complete this assessment.
It was a lot of fun taking on these tasks you supplied.
I hope I have fulfilled them to your standards. 

**Tasks Handled:**
1)  **Question 1**

    a)  The counter variable was not included in the scope of the function.
      Thus, I added the "global counter" to correct this error.

2)  **Question 2**

    a)  Running question2 through pytest results in a failure message.
        Thus, I changed the value of inc() from 3 to 4 in order for the function to succeed and saved the file as answer2.
        
    b)  *Images included as proof*

3)  **Question 3**

    a)  Created a python script named response_time.py
    
    b)  Imported the following python libraries: request, time, os
        
        import requests
        import time
        import os
        
    c)  Created a function that takes a int and a str variable
    
    d)  Created a float variable called "time_lapse" in order to sum the response time
    
    e)  Included a time method from the time library to record the function time elapsed

4)  **Question 4**
