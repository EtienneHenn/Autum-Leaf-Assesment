# Autum-Leaf-Assesment

Hello viewer :)

I hope you are having a great day.

Thank you for allowing me to complete this assessment.
It was a lot of fun taking on these tasks you supplied.
I hope I have fulfilled them to your standards. 

Tasks Handled:
1)  Question 1

    a)  The counter variable was not included in the scope of the function.
      Thus, I added the "global counter" to correct this error.

2)  Question 2

    a)  Running question 2 through pytest results in a failure message.
        Thus, I changed the number value of inc() from 3 to 4 inorder for the function to succeed.
        *Images included as proof

3)  
    

1)  Created a docker file
